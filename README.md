# HM-Detect
HM-Detect is a novel heart murmur detection and classification method using techniques in sound feature analysis, signal processing, and machine learning.

This method was trained on the CirCor DigiScope Phonocardiogram Database.

The proposed method classifies murmur location (aortic, pulmonary, mitral, or tricuspid valves) using multiple stages of random forest classifiers. The method also uses an LSTM to classify the timing of a heart murmur between fundamental sounds S1 and S2 (early-, mid-, late-, or holo-systolic).
